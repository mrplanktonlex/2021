Actions (ALL_ACTIONS/HELLO_ACTIONS/HI_ACTIONS), Reducers, ActionReducerMap
+
IMP: How to use actionsindex.ts and reducersindex.ts which will export all actions and all reducers respectively .

Problem:-
https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ngrxtest221 		Problem of scalability. Problem eg. 
	// create hi.action.ts and hi.reducer.ts 
	// add them to app.module.ts and app.component.ts 
	
	NOTE: app.module.ts and app.component.ts are having a lot of import-statements.
	      and as we begin to add more and more actions and reducers, these files will have a lot lot of import statements. 
		  so, we need to have a wrapper file like this
				actions/
				actions/index.ts (which will export all *.actions.ts files)
				
				reducers/
				reducers/index.ts (which will export all *.reducer.ts files)
				
Solution:-        
Solution is available in this URL: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ngrxtest222
				   https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ngrxtest223 (actionreducermaps/ can further remove the clutter in app.module.ts)	
	actions/actionsindex.ts 
		export * from './hello.action';		// hello.action should not have multiple exports, but one "export {} " statement 
		export * from './hi.action';		// hi.action should not have multiple exports, but one " export {} " statement 
			(Also see hello.action.ts)
			(Also see hi.action.ts)

	reducers/reducersindex.ts 
		export * from './hello.reducer';
		export * from './hi.reducer';
